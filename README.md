## Logging Events
Each log is sent with a number of fields required by [SimpleLog](https://github.com/fielddaylab/simplelog). Simple log allows for a custom field called event_data_complex along with its category enumerator:
  event_custom: category enumerator
  event_data_complex: JSON.stringify(log_data)
Each log_data is a JSON object for that specific category as defined below.
